  "summary": "Prompt injection occurs when attackers craft inputs that manipulate a language model into producing unintended, harmful, or unauthorized outputs. These attacks can be direct—overriding the model’s intended behaviour—or indirect, where malicious instructions are hidden in third-party content and later processed by the model. This threat can lead to misinformation, data leakage, reputational damage, or unsafe automated actions, especially in systems without strong safeguards or human oversight.",
  "description": "Prompt injection is a significant security threat in LLM-based applications, where both external users and malicious internal actors can manipulate the prompts sent to a language model to induce unintended, harmful, or malicious behaviour. This attack vector is particularly dangerous because it typically requires no special privileges and can be executed through simple input manipulation—making it one of the most accessible and widely exploited threats in LLM systems.\n\nUnlike traditional injection attacks like SQL injection, the scope of prompt injection is broader and less predictable, encompassing risks such as:\n- Incorrect or misleading answers\n- Toxic or offensive content\n- Leakage of sensitive or proprietary information\n- Denial of service or resource exhaustion\n- Reputational harm through unethical or biased responses\n\nA well-known public example is the DPD chatbot incident, where a chatbot integrated with an LLM produced offensive and sarcastic replies when prompted in unexpected ways.",

      "description": "The rapid and widespread integration of generative AI into application workflows, either through direct API calls, agentic workflows, or the client-server concept of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), brings forth emerging risks. These risks include model inversion, prompt injection, and data exfiltration or leakage. Given these threats, there is a growing necessity for a security system like an AI firewall. Such a firewall would intercept and analyze communication between user and agent, agent and tools, and even inter-agent communication. Its functions should include, but not be limited to, threat detection, monitoring, alerting, blocking, reporting, and implementing guardrails to preserve Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and the confidentiality of sensitive data.",

      "description": "As in any information system component, you can monitor and filter interactions between the model, inputs from the user, queries to RAG databases or other sources of information, and outputs. A simple analogy is a Web Access Firewall detecting URLs trying to exploit known vulnerabilities in specific server versions, and detecting and filtering from the output malicious Javascript code embedded in the returned web page.\n\nNot only user input and LLM output should be considered. To populate the RAG database with custom information, it has to use the same tokenizer that follows the exact same embeddings format (converting words to vectors) that the LLM uses. This means that for an LLM in a SaaS where the tokenizer is available as an endpoint, you have to send the full information to the embeddings endpoint to convert it to vectors, and store the returned data into your RAG database.",
